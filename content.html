                            <p>Each color offers a distinct meaning: red, the lover's rose, signifies enduring passion; white, humility and innocence; yellow, expressing friendship and joy; pink, gratitude, appreciation and admiration; orange, enthusiasm and desire; white lilac and purple roses represent enchantment and love at first sight. The number of stems in a rose bouquet can also express specific sentiments.</p>

    <div class="grid-item1"><h3> TULIPS</h3>
                            <p>The meaning of tulips is generally perfect love. Like many flowers, different colors of tulips also often carry their own significance. Red tulips are most strongly associated with true love, while purple symbolizes royalty. The meaning of yellow tulips has evolved somewhat, from once representing hopeless love to now being a common expression for cheerful thoughts and sunshine. White tulips are used to claim worthiness or to send a message of forgiveness. Variegated tulips, once among the most popular varieties due to their striking color patterns, represent beautiful eyes.</p>

    <div class="grid-item2"><h3> HYDRANGEAS</h3>
                            <p>The etymological meaning of hydrangea stems from the Greek words for water, hydros and jar, angos. The name comes from the constant moisture required to keep the flowers happy, healthy and blooming. In Japan, they are said to be a sign of apology or gratitude because an emperor gave them as apologies to his maidens.</p>

    <div class="grid-item1"><h3> SUNFLOWERS</h3>
                            <p>Sunflowers symbolize adoration, loyalty and longevity. Much of the meaning of sunflowers stems from its namesake, the sun itself. These flowers are unique in that they have the ability to provide energy in the form of nourishment and vibrancy—attributes which mirror the sun and the energy provided by its heat and light.</p>

    <div class="grid-item2"><h3> GERBERA DAISIES</h3>
                            <p>The Gerbera currently ranks as the fifth most popular flower in the world behind the rose, carnations, chrysanthemum, and tulip. Their meanings stem from those attributed to the general daisy family and include innocence and purity, as well as being a classic symbol of beauty. However, the Gerbera variety holds an added meaning of cheerfulness, which is attributed to their perky variety of colors. An assorted bouquet of Gerbera daisies can quickly lift the spirit and are an ideal way to brighten someone’s day.</p>

    <div class="grid-item1"><h3> IRIS FLOWERS</h3>
                            <p>The meaning of the iris is faith, hope, and wisdom. Depending on factors such as color and region, irises may bear additional meanings as well. In some parts of the world, the dark blue or purple iris can denote royalty, whereas the yellow iris can be a symbol of passion. Irises may also express courage and admiration. The many meanings of the iris makes the flower a great choice for an array of gift giving occasions: corporate, sympathy, get well, just because, and birthday are just some of the occasions for which irises might be the perfect choice.</p>
